              As a software engineer, I designed, developed, and maintained web-based applications using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, AngularJS, ReactJS, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, and Materialize CSS. I created database-driven web applications, implemented complex JavaScript functionality, and created visually appealing front-end designs. I collaborated with cross-functional teams, communicated with stakeholders, and provided technical support to end-users. My role required diverse technical skills and the ability to deliver high-quality software solutions.
